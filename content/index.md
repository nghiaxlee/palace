title: Welcome to my memory palace
---

I've been looking for a way to store my thoughts, because as you know, ideas just come and go. The most intuitive way is to write them down! Despite being someone who spends the majority of my time in front of the computer, I always struggle in typing my thoughts, papers just work best for me. However, recently I found out about [[Obsidian]] with backlinks, and it looks like a love at the first sight for me. Not sure how things will turn out in the future but I want to also employ [[learning in public]] strategy and make some of the notes public, the reasons are:
- Building a public memory palace[^1] which I've been fonded of since the first time I watched [[Sherlock]]
- Sharing my little knowledge
- Inspiring others to build similar things

For now, check out [[Random Quotes]], [[Code snippets]]

[^1]: [[Second Brain]] might be a more appropriate name, I just want to reference this as the first inspirator
